<p>
First, make sure you have an active campaign and are in the active combat view (<i class='v-icon notranslate mdi mdi-view-dashboard' style='font-size: 16px;'></i>).
</p>

<p>
You can right click an active combat member for a context menu.
There, you can click on the Add Alert item.<br/>

<p>
Alternatively, you can choose to add an alert on the round itself.<br/>
This is done in the same way, by right clicking for a context menu and selecting the Add Round Alert item.<br/>

</p>

<p>
This will open up a dialog screen, in which you fill in the details of the alert. <br />
Importantly, this also includes whether or not you want the alert to be removed on triggering. <br />
Once you are finished, you can save the alert. <br />
