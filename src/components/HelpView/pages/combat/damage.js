First, make sure you have an active campaign and are in the active combat view (<i class='v-icon notranslate mdi mdi-view-dashboard' style='font-size: 16px;'></i>).
</p>

<p>
You can right click an active combat member for a context menu.
There, you can click on the Damage Combatant item.<br/>

<p>
This will open up a dialog screen, in which you fill in the details of the damage. <br />

This won't double the damage, but it will add a dying condition of value 2 when it reduces the creature to 0 HP.
