<h2>The General Interface</h2>
<p>So for most specific topics in regards to the interface we refer to those topics (for instance, combat also convers the interface).</p>
<p>However, here we would like to cover some of the basics.<p>

<p>Firstly, RSD heavily used context-menu's to hide a lot of controls. So, if you're using a mouse, 
try right clicking a lot of stuff (especially on the left side of the interface). <br/>
If you're on a touch device, you can try holding it down, but do note this doesn't work on all devices (yet).</p>

<p><b>We aim to work on those devices, but this is all heavily WIP</b></p>

<p>Secondly, note the interface on the left functions as your menu throughout the application.<br/>
<img src='/img/help/interface-1.png' width='30'/> -> <img src='/img/help/interface-2.png' width='30'/><br/>
Also note, that you can click these buttons a second time to hide most of the context on the left side and have
more of a 'full screen' experience.</p>

<p>Next, we have the top bars.<br/>
The red bar is our title bar and includes the name for the page you are on.<br/>
On the right side we have a button with some info and the account menu. This also includes your unique UserID, and the logout button.<br/>

<p>Finally, the second top bar functions as a hotbar for actions.</p>
