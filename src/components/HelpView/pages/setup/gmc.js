<p>
These are basically the same as the PC characters, except they are fully managed by you, the GM.
</p>

<p>
First, you need to go to the party view (<i class='v-icon notranslate mdi mdi-account-group' style='font-size: 16px;'></i>). <br />
There, you can click on the Add GMC button on the bottom of the list. <br />

</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can right click any of the current party members for a context menu.<br />
There, you can click on the Add GMC item from the list. <br />
<img src='/img/help/setup-5.png' width='200'/>
</p>

<p>
This will open up a dialog screen, in which you must fill in the name of the new GMC. <br />

</p>

<p>
Pressing the create button will thus add the new GMC to the party. <br />
