<h2>Inviting players to your campaign</h2>
<p>
Start by browsing to a view that has a campaign selector, like the campaign view (<i class='v-icon notranslate mdi mdi-view-dashboard' style='font-size: 16px;'></i>).
</p>

<p>
There, you're going to right click on the campaign selector. <br />
Within the drop context menu, you can click "Copy Invite Link". <br />

</p>

<p>
The final thing for you to do is send this to any of your players. <br />
<b>They will need to have an account, and an existing character.</b> <br />
If both of these conditions are met, they will get a pop-up dialog that allows them to select one of their characters.
