</p>

<p>
There's a couple of ways to achieve this.
</p>

<p>
First, if this is the first time you're visiting RSD, or you've deleted your active campaign, the campaign selector will be open.<br/>
There, you can click on the following option.<br/>
<img src='/img/help/setup-1.png' width='150'/>
</p>

<p>
The second option, is to right click (or hold down on touch device) to open the context menu.<br/>
There, you can click on the marked option.<br/>
<img src='/img/help/setup-2.png' width='200'/>
</p>

<p>
This will open a dialog screen that will allow you to fill in a name for your campaign.<br/>
<img src='/img/help/setup-3.png' width='450'/><br />
Confirming this dialog will create a new campaign with it's own settings, a random color and icon, with the party set to level 1.
</p>

<p>
To change any of these, simply right click the campaign and select one of the options from the context menu.
