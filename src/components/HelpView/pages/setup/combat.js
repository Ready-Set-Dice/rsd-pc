<p>
First, make sure you have an active campaign, party and an encounter.
</p>

<p>
Then, you need to go to the campaign view (<i class='v-icon notranslate mdi mdi-view-dashboard' style='font-size: 16px;'></i>). <br />
There, you can right click the current combat and select Add Party.<br />

Next, you can right click one of your encounters and select Load Into Combat.<br />

</p>

<p>
This will open up a dialog screen, in which you are asked if you want to load the encounter. <br />
Note that this will remove every non-party combatant from the current combat. <br />

<p>
Alternatively, you can also add combatants straight into combat. <br />
This is done through the right clicking the current combat or a combatant. <br />
